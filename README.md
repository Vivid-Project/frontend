## Project Overview

> What are your dreams telling you?

VIVID is a full-stack collaborative project built completely from scratch by our team at Turing School of Software & Design.

Use VIVID to log your dreams and receive back an analysis of unique tones inside of them. Track these tones over time with interactive charts detailing the frequency of your emotions over time.

As a Progressive Web Application, Vivid is fully reactive and ready to be used as an application on your mobile device without needing to install anything. (_See the installation section for more details_)

Visit the [VIVID backend](https://github.com/Vivid-Project/backend) to explore possible API endpoints and a more in depth view of the dark side.

## Installation

_Note: VIVID works best on mobile!_

#### Mobile:

Navigate to our live site at https://vivid-project.herokuapp.com/ with your mobile device. _(Note: You may have to wait for Heroku to load. If you receive an error message from Heroku, reload the page and the app will be displayed. This is due to the free tier hosting)_

Once you reach the login screen, add the site to your home screen. You can find a helpful article explaining how to that [here](https://www.howtogeek.com/196087/how-to-add-websites-to-the-home-screen-on-any-smartphone-or-tablet/).

Launch Vivid from your home screen. It now functions exactly like an application!

#### Desktop:

In your console, navigate to a directory you want to download the repo to and type

`$ git clone git@github.com:Vivid-Project/frontend.git`

Navigate into the new directory

`$ cd frontend/`

Install dependancies 

`$ npm install`

Start the application 

`$ npm start`

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browswer to use the application!

Alternatively, navigate to the deployed site at https://vivid-project.herokuapp.com/ _(Note: You may have to wait for Heroku to load. If you receive an error message from Heroku, reload the page and the app will be displayed. This is due to the free tier hosting)_

#### Logging In:

Login as an existing user, or create your own account. You may have to wait for the Heroku backend to start up. Logins for existing users are below:

> user: mjones@example.com
>
> password: password

> user: adrew@example.com
